# A2744
Abell 2744 is perhaps the most iconic example of a complex galaxy cluster merger. It seems that every time someone observers it anew, be it in the X-ray or gravitational lensing, they discover a new merging component, earning the system the nickname Pandora's Cluster. Merging clusters, due to their highly dynamic nature, are fantastic sites in which to explore questions of plasma physics. The appearance of shock fronts, cold fronts and radio relics all hold information about the strength and distribution of magnetic fields, thermal conduction, viscosity, and electron-ion equilibriation processes in the weakly magnetised intracluster medium (ICM). To measure these quantities, however, we first need a dynamical model of the system. What is moving where? 

Reconstructing the dynamics is complex enough for [binary mergers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.1201C/abstract), with key free parameters including the cluster mass profiles, gas density and temperature profiles, relative velocities, angular momentum, and viewing direction (i.e. 10 parameters). Every additional merging component adds O(N) parameters, and exploring the parameter space blindly quickly becomes unfeasible.
